 * pushes the model to use tools and act. Since the analyzed transcripts are untrusted
 * and routinely contain literal task requests ("create a PR", "run the loop", "load
 * the skill"), that framing has caused analysis calls to *execute* transcript content
 * instead of summarizing it. This system prompt re-establishes a read-only,
 * non-agentic analyzer role. Tools are also hard-disabled at the call site (see
 * runLlmOnce) as defense-in-depth — this prompt reduces the impulse, the tool lock
 * removes the capability.

Given the transcript and session metadata below, extract structured information about this session.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. **goal_categories**: Count ONLY what the USER explicitly asked for.
   - DO NOT count the agent's autonomous codebase exploration
   - DO NOT count work the agent decided to do on its own
   - ONLY count when user says "can you...", "please...", "I need...", "let's..."

2. **user_satisfaction_counts**: Base ONLY on explicit user signals.
   - "Yay!", "great!", "perfect!" → happy
   - "thanks", "looks good", "that works" → satisfied
   - "ok, now let's..." (continuing without complaint) → likely_satisfied
   - "that's not right", "try again" → dissatisfied
   - "this is broken", "I give up" → frustrated
   - no clear signals either way → neutral

3. **friction_counts**: Be specific about what went wrong.

## Session Transcript

ACTOR ATTRIBUTION: In all free-text fields, attribute actions correctly — the AGENT runs tools, writes/edits code, and debugs ("the agent…"); YOU (the user) make requests, give context, and verify ("you…"). Tooling/environment failures (timeouts, plugin/CLI bugs) belong to neither.

Return a JSON object with these fields:
- "session_id": string
- "underlying_goal": string — what the user asked for / was trying to accomplish
- "goal_categories": object with keys [${categoriesStr}], each mapped to 0 or 1
- "outcome": one of "fully_achieved", "mostly_achieved", "partially_achieved", "not_achieved", "unclear"
- "satisfaction": object with keys [${satisfactionStr}], each mapped to 0 or 1 (exactly one should be 1)
- "friction_counts": object with keys [${FRICTION_CATEGORIES.join(", ")}], each mapped to a count integer
- "friction_detail": string — brief description of the main friction point if any, else empty string; name the actor (agent / you / tooling)
- "primary_success": string — the main thing that went well, naming who did it (e.g. "your agent fixed the auth bug after you flagged it"), or "none"
- "brief_summary": string — 2-3 sentences max; attribute actions to agent vs you, never crediting agent work to the user

## OPENCODE FEATURES REFERENCE (pick from these for features_to_try):

1. **Skills**: Reusable prompt templates run with a /command.
   - How to use: Create \`.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` with instructions. Type \`/<name>\` to run it.
   - Good for: repetitive workflows — /commit, /review, /pr, /deploy, /test

2. **AGENTS.md Rules**: Project-wide instructions the agent always follows.
   - How to use: Edit \`.opencode/AGENTS.md\` (or \`AGENTS.md\` in repo root).
   - Good for: coding standards, test requirements, preferred patterns

3. **Custom Commands**: Markdown files that become slash commands with shell injection.
   - How to use: Create \`.opencode/commands/<name>.md\` with frontmatter + template.
   - Good for: consistent workflows, running tests, reviewing changes

4. **Plugins**: Extend opencode with custom tools and hooks.
   - How to use: Add to \`opencode.json\` under the \`"plugin"\` array.
   - Good for: custom integrations, auto-formatting, external API access

5. **Headless Mode**: Run opencode non-interactively from scripts.
   - How to use: \`opencode run "fix lint errors"\`
   - Good for: CI/CD integration, batch code fixes, automated workflows

USER DATA:

   - "agent_execution": what your AGENT executes well (e.g. tool precision, methodical debugging, recovering when blocked). Do NOT credit this to the user.

2. **whats_hindering** — split into three parts:
   - "agent": agent-caused friction (misunderstandings, wrong approaches, bugs in agent-written code).
   - "user_side": user-caused friction (too little context, rarely invoking skills, skipping verification before declaring work done).
   - "tooling": tooling/environment problems (plugin bugs, timeouts, external CLI/API errors). Empty string if none.

3. **quick_wins** — specific opencode features or a compelling workflow technique you could adopt.

4. **ambitious_workflows** — As models improve over the next 3-6 months, what should you prepare for? What workflows that seem impossible now will become possible?

Keep each sub-part to 1-2 not-too-long sentences. Don't overwhelm. Don't mention specific numerical stats. Coaching tone. Attribute actions to the correct actor (agent vs you vs tooling) throughout.
